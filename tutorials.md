I am Kamalvir Kaur.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing and many more. It was easy to solve all the questions as instructions were clear and concise from basic to advance levels. I learnt all the basics of git in an easy manner but if we want to check some step it will start again from beginning.

Very insightful tutorials! I gained an understanding of cloning with SSH, making changes to an existing repository without affecting the original (forking), managing files, creating commits, and using push and pull commands.

I am slowly going through this by doing hand on practice. So far these are excelllent resources. However, setting up SSH key in my account was challenging.

### Oluwatobiloba Kikiowo: 
I went through different Git tutorials that covered things like branching, merging, and rebasing. It was easy to understand and solve all the questions because the instructions were clear and straightforward, starting from the basics and going to more advanced stuff. Learning the basics was simple, but if you needed to review a specific step, you had to start over from the beginning.
