I am Kamalvir Kaur.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing and many more. It was easy to solve all the questions as instructions were clear and concise from basic to advance levels. I learnt all the basics of git in an easy manner but if we want to check some step it will start again from beginning.
